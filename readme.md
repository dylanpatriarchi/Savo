# The Savo Language

## Introduction

The Savo language is a simple scripting language designed to be used in a console environment. It provides a set of commands and statements for performing various tasks, such as printing output, managing files, and executing loops.

## Getting Started

To start using the Savo language, simply navigate to the directory containing the Savo executable (`savo.exe`) using your terminal or command prompt. Once there, you can begin entering Savo commands and scripts directly into the console.

Syntax:
```bash
savoprint "message"
```

The `DIR` statement is used to list the contents of a directory.

Syntax:
```bash
savodir [arguments]
```

### Help Statement

The `savohelp` statement displays information about available Savo commands and statements.

Syntax:
```bash

### Quit Statement

The `savoquit` statement exits the Savo console.
